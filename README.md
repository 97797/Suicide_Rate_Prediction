# Suicide_Rate_Prediction
Socio-economic Info with Suicide Rates by Year and Country

This dataset contains 12 features:

country: The country of residence of the individual

year: The year the suicide happend
sex: The gender of the individual (male/female)
age group: The age group of the individual

gdpforyear: The GDP of the country at that year

During this analysis, we will first perform an exploratory data analysis where we will try to extract a few useful insights from our dataset.
Secondly, we will clean our data and make the needed transformation(We will keep transforming our data whenever it's needed during the analysis). Finally we will try to predict the number of suicides per 100k given the features we have.

And then we will dorm clusters based on demography and on the suicide rates.
